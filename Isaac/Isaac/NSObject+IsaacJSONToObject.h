 TL;DR: Call
 
    [jsonDictionary isc_objectFromJSONWithClass:]
 
 to get a foundation model object from a JSON dictionary.
 
 This is the main way to parse JSON directly into objects. Here's how you use it:
 With an NSDictionary representing JSON data, call [dictionary isc_objectFromJSONWithClass:] and give the class of the top-level object.
 
 Your foundation model should be a subclass of NSObject with the following:
 
 * All fields in the model are readwrite properties.
 * The JSON keys match the property names exactly (read below if you don't want a direct mapping)
 * The value types from JSON will match your model. For example, you have an int property, and the JSON value will be a number.
 * Objects with arrays must implement classForObject:inArrayWithKey:
 
 You can also override methods in NSObject (IsaacJSONToObjectModel) to customize model parsing.
 
 * Override isc_setJSONValue:forJSONKey: to totally take control of a key. Call super's version for keys you don't customize.
 * Override isc_keyForJSONKey: to change the mapping between JSON keys and property names. Call super for keys you don't customize.
 * Override isc_classForObject:inArrayWithKey: if you have an array of custom objects. If you have an array of NSString, NSDictionary or NSValue (including NSNumbers), you don't need this.
 * Override isc_classForObjectKey: to change the class mapping. For example, if you want to create a MyObject for an id property.
 
 Nested arrays are tricky, but possible. If you have a nested array with just JSON types (strings, values, dictionaries, arrays)
 then things will work fine. If you have a nested array with custom objects, you'll need to override isc_setJSONValue:forJSONKey:
 in the model object to handle the top-level array property.

 Limitations:
 
 * The top level JSON must be a dictionary, not an array or value type.
 * Your models cannot have nested arrays. classForObject:inArrayWithKey: must return a custom type or nil.
 * If you declare a property as a superclass of what you actually want it to be (like id instead of a custom class)
     you will need to override classForObjectKey:.
