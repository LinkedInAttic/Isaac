 This is a wrapper around setValue:forKey: that will never crash.
 So it's behavior is exactly the same, except that if the class is not KVO compliant, setValue:forKey: will crash, while this will just do nothing.
 
 \discussion For more information, see the documentation for setValue:forKey:
 
 \param value The value for the property identified by key.
 \param key The name of one of the receiver's properties.
