  // I would just check for respondsToSelector(@selector(set<key>:)) but that's not as general.
  // In terms of performance, I've tested this code with and without the try/catch, and it seems like this method is approximately
  // 1% slower with the try catch. This isn't worth worrying about, so I see no performance question here.
