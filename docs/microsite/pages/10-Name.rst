Isaac - The name
====================

Why did we name this library Isaac?
---------------------------------------

Originally, we wanted to name this library Alchemist. Alchemy is the process of turning lead into gold. For this library, we like the idea of turning messy, annoying-to-use NSDictionary objects into clean, golden model objects.

However, it seemed the name was trademarked, so we needed to be more creative. When searching for famous alchemists, we decided to name the library after Isaac Newton (while not inventing calculus, he gave Alchemy a try). Admittedly, now, there isn't really a strong link between the name and library and functionality. But that's ok.
