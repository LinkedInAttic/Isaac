We have two sets of docs for this library.
1) API Docs
These are autogenerated from the source code using appledoc. There is a build target which generates this. This can then be viewed by opening html/index.html
2) Microsite Docs
These are contained in microsite. It uses sphinx to generate a website from rst files. To build the site:
$ easy_install sphinx
$ cd microsite
$ make html

Then you can view the site in _build/html/index.html
