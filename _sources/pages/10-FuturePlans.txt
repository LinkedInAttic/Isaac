Code Generator
--------------

Even with this library, you still need to write the .h for model objects. It'd be really nice if there was a tool which took JSON as an input and outputted .h and .m model files. It'd maybe need some more input (possibly prompted?) which asked for the names of the models since that's not clear from the JSON.
